## Description 
For this weeks homework we were tasked with completing the backend code to be able to enter and retreive workout entries in the mongoose database, we were provided with the front end code so that we only had to work with mongoose. The aim was to have the user land on the homepage and be presented with the information of the previous workout and be given the option to add exercises to the workout or create a new workout entirely, the user can click on the tracker page to view the weekly stats. The main learning points of this project were creating a mongoose schema
